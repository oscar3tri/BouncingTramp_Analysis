# BouncingTramp_Analysis

In this repository you can find the data set gathered and analyzed for my Master Thesis project. In short, this project aim to find a proper set of action to be implemented in an Exergame for Interactive Trampolines. Specifically, I perform a A/B Test for two different versions of an Exergame called BouncingTramp. These version only were differenciated by the action set used to control de game.

You might find two files with the same information but with different extensions. If you seek to run the code in Jupyter Notebook, I suggest you open the .ipynb file. Otherwise, if you only want to take a look at how Jupyter Notebook looks like without installing it, I suggest you open de .html file by clicking the next link:
